## Responsive Web Design
Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop.

Responsive web design is broken down into three main components :-
1. flexible layouts
2. media queries
3. flexible media

### Relative Viewport lengths

Units | name
------|-----
vw | Viewport width
vh | Viewport height
vmin | Minimum of the viewport's height and width
vmax | Maximum of the viewport's height and width

## Float
Float : is a CSS positioning property.

#### What are floats used for?
floats can be used to create entire web layouts.

notice :-
Using floats can introduce up to two new flows: left and right.
And this allows the normal flow of elements, those without a float value, to fill in the spaces around these elements.

### Clear
allows elements to specify where they should align in comparison to the floated elements.
