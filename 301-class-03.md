## Javascript Templating
Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source. The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.

## Mustache
Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code â€” anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.

### display
This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children.

.container {
  display: flex; /* or inline-flex */
}

### order
By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the order property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container.
.item {
  order: < integer >; /* default is 0 */
}

### flex-grow
This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.

### flex-direction
This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of flex items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.

### flex-wrap
.container{
  flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;
}

### flex-shrink
.item {
  flex-shrink: < number>; /* default 1 */
}
