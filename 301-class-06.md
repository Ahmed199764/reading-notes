# Node.js

### What Is Node and When Should I Use It?
1. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
2. Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

so what is V8 ?
The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

### What Is Node.js Used For?
These build tools which are npm and node come in all shapes and sizes, and you won’t get far in a modern JavaScript landscape without bumping into them. They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.

### Node.js Lets Us Run JavaScript on the Server
Next we come to one of the biggest use cases for Node.js — running JavaScript on the server. This isn’t a new concept, and was first attempted by Netscape way back in 1994. Node.js, however, is the first implementation to gain any real traction, and it provides some unique benefits, compared to traditional languages. Node now plays a critical role in the technology stack of many high-profile companies.


### What Are the Advantages of Node.js?
1. speed
2. scalability 
3. using js on web server 
4. your brain no need longer to switch modes
5. you can do everything in same language
6. you can easily share code between the server and the client
7. it speaks with JSON
