## system complexity.
Complexity is anything that makes software hard to understand or to modify.

### What is functional programming?
Functional programming is a programming paradigm a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

### pure functions ?
is the first fundamental concept we learn when we want to understand functional programming.

how do we know if a function is pure or not?
1. It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
2. It does not cause any observable side effects

### Reading Files
If our function reads external files, it’s not a pure function — the file’s contents can change.

### Random number generation
Any function that relies on a random number generator cannot be pure.

### It does not cause any observable side effects
Examples of observable side effects include modifying a global object or a parameter passed by reference.
