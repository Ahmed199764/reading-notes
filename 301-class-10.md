# Call stack
A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions

### what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function :-
1. When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
2. Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
3. When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
4. If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error.

### The JavaScript engine 
which is found in a hosting environment like the browser, is a single-threaded interpreter comprising of a heap and a single call stack. The browser provides web APIs like the DOM, AJAX, and Timers.


### Manage function invocation (call):
 The call stack maintains a record of the position of each stack frame. It knows the next function to be executed (and will remove it after execution). This is what makes code execution in JavaScript synchronous.

### How does the call stack handle function calls?
We will answer this question by looking at a sample code of a function that calls another function. Here is the example code:

function firstFunction(){ console.log("Hello from firstFunction");}

function secondFunction(){ firstFunction(); console.log("The end from secondFunction");}

secondFunction();

This is what happens when the code is run:

1. When secondFunction() gets executed, an empty stack frame is created. It is the main (anonymous) entry point of the program.
2. secondFunction() then calls firstFunction()which is pushed into the stack.
3. firstFunction() returns and prints “Hello from firstFunction” to the console.
4. firstFunction() is pop off the stack.
5. The execution order then move to secondFunction().
6. secondFunction() returns and print “The end from secondFunction” to the console.
7. secondFunction() is pop off the stack, clearing the memory.

### What causes a stack overflow?
A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.

##### Here is an example:
function callMyself(){  callMyself();}callMyself();
