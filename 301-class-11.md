# EJS

to start working (intro) :-
steps
1. npm inti -y
2. npm install --save express body-parser cors ejs
3. start write the code 
4. call the libaries 
5. set views , path ( parth will take 2 path and join them)
6. create new files views and index
7. add app.listen to the code
8. create a path dirctory with requst and response objects 
9. render the response with index name
10. node js file name will run the code


### Inject value into the view (index.ejs file)
1. replace word in ejs file to <% and link with name or id  %>
2. back to js and write the render
3. nodemon , will work cuz we used EJS Tags ( % )
4. we can use them also inside image path as example or links

### Loops and Arrays
Inject values from js to ejs , same steps as before :-
1. replace word in ejs file to <% and link with name or id  %>
2. back to js and write the render
3. nodemon , will work cuz we used EJS Tags ( % )
4. we can use them also inside image path as example or links

### if and for statmenst :-
we can use them as we used arrays and objects inside the ejs file.

### Parials 
we can use include function as example inside EJS file.
