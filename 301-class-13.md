## Sending form data
Once the form data has been validated on the client-side, it is okay to submit the form. And, since we covered validation in the previous article, we're ready to submit!

### What is the diffrences between prerequistes and objective ?
Prerequisites:	Basic computer literacy, an understanding of HTML, and basic knowledge of HTTP and server-side programming.
Objective:	To understand what happens when form data is submitted, including getting a basic idea of how data is processed on the server.

### The method attribute
The method attribute defines how data is sent. The HTTP protocol provides several ways to perform a request; HTML form data can be transmitted via a number of different methods, the most common being the GET method and the POST method.

##### The GET method
The GET method is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource: "Hey server, I want to get this resource." In this case, the browser sends an empty body. Because the body is empty, if a form is sent using this method the data sent to the server is appended to the URL.

##### The POST method
The POST method is a little different. It's the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request: "Hey server, take a look at this data and send me back an appropriate result." If a form is sent using this method, the data is appended to the body of the HTTP request.

###### Viewing HTTP requests

2. Select "Network"
