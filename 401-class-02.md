### Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
1. Writing the tests first requires you to really consider what do you want from the code.
2. You receive fast feedback.
3. TDD creates a detailed specification.

### In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
There is no documentation on when a beforeEach or afterEach will run. My intuition states that it should be run before/after every describe/it block in the current context completes.

However, the behavior I am noticing, is that beforeEach and afterEach are run before/after every it block in the current context and all nested contexts

### What is one downside of Test Driven Development
The biggest downside is that if you really want to do TDD properly you will have to fail a lot before you succeed.

### Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
Classes. The most important difference between class- and prototype-based inheritance is that a class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance. ... Functions are first-class in JavaScript, and they can have properties or be properties of other objects

### Name a use case for a static method
Static Getter

### Write an example of a Higher Order function and describe the use case it solves
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [];
for(let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
  arr2.push(arr1[i] * 2);
}
// prints [ 2, 4, 6 ]
console.log(arr2);

Higher-Order Functions are extensively used in JavaScript. If you have been programming in JavaScript for a while, you may have already used them without even knowing.
To fully understand this concept, you first have to understand what Functional Programming is and the concept of First-Class Functions.


 Term | Definition 
 ----- | ------
 functional programming | In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions
 pure function |  In computer programming, a pure function is a function that has the following properties: ... floor , returning the floor of a number;; max , returning the maximum of two values.
 higher-order function | In mathematics and computer science, a higher-order function is a function that does at least ... In Elixir, you can mix module definitions and anonymous functions.
 immutable state| In object-oriented and functional programming, an immutable object (unchangeable object) is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created.
 object | is anything that has a fixed shape or form, that you can touch or see
 class | a number of persons or things regarded as forming a group by reason of common attributes, characteristics, qualities, or traits
 prototype | an original model on which something is patterned
 super | is a keyword. It is used inside a sub-class method definition to call a method defined in the super class
 inheritance | Inheritance is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages
 constructor | Constructor is a block of code that initializes the newly created object
 instance|  is one occurrence of a class or object. For example, a program may have a class/object named Animal, but there could be many instances of Animal, such as lion, cat, and dog.
 context |  Provides an abstraction of a position in code as known to the debug engine (DE). For most run-time architectures today, a code context can be thought of as an address in a program's instruction stream.
 this | we use it to call back a value from same constructor
 Test Driven Development (TDD)| is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the code is improved so that the tests pass.
 Jest | aims to work out of the box, config free, on most JavaScript projects
 Continuous Integration (CI)| is the practice of merging all developers' ... Committing all changes at least once a day (once per feature built) is generally considered part of the definition of Continuous Integration.
 unit test | is a software testing method by which individual units of ... The same is true for unit testing.
