### Why would a developer choose to make data models?
A data model not only improves the conceptual quality of an application, it also lets you leverage database features that improve data quality. Developers can weave constraints into the fabric of a model and the resulting database. For example, every table should normally have a primary key.

### What purpose do CRUD operations serve?
In computer programming, create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) are the four basic functions of persistent storage. Alternate words are sometimes used when defining the four basic functions of CRUD, such as retrieve instead of read, modify instead of update, or destroy instead of delete.

### What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?
MongoDB is an open source, non- relational database management system. PostgreSQL is a relational database management system. MongoDB has mainly programmed in C and C++ programming language and JavaScript language.

### What is Mongoose and why do we need it?
Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node. js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

### Describe how NoSQL Databases scale horizontally
Relational database or RDBMS databases are vertically Scalable When load increase on RDBMS database then we scale database by increasing server hardware power ,need to by expensive and bigger servers and NoSQL databases are designed to expand horizontally and in Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding

### Give one strong argument for and against NoSQL Databases
Large volumes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data
NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID)

### Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department.
id , primary key , type : int.
name , type : varchar.
age , type : varchar.
each student have an id , name and age.

### Name 3 cloud based NoSQL Databases
1. Amazon DynamoDB.
2. Amazon SimpleDB.
3. Azure Cosmos DB.

database | A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system
data model | is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities
CRUD | CREATE , READ , UPDATE , DELETE
schema | is a cognitive framework or concept that helps organize and interpret information
sanitize | refers to lowering the number of germs on a surface to a safe level
Structured Query Language (SQL) | is a programming nomenclature used to do set operations (like union, intersect, and minus) to organize and retrieve information in relational databases
Non SQL (NoSQL) | database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.
MongoDB | the most popular database for modern apps, and MongoDB Atlas, the global cloud database on AWS, Azure, and GCP.
Mongoose | provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data.
record |  to store sounds or moving pictures using electronic equipment so that they can be heard or seen
document | means all documents prepared by Manufacturer in the ordinary course of business that define the Product in terms 
Object Relation Mapping (ORM) |  is a programming technique in which a metadata descriptor is used to connect object code to a relational database
