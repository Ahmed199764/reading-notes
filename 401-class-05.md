### what type of data structure Linked list use?

1. linear data structures:  is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed. 

2. non-linear data structures : items don’t have to be arranged in order, which means that we could traverse the data structure non-sequentially.

 

### why a linked list doesn’t need a contiguous block of memory ?

Because a single node has the “address” or a reference to the next node, they don’t need to live right next to one another.

### how to add node to linked list?

We can do an AddBefore method or an AddAfter.
