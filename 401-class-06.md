# HTTP 

### what is HTTP (Intro) ?
The Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless request-response application layer protocol. HTTP is used to build distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation for the world wide web. Applications built using HTTP subscribe to the client-server computing model. In the client-server computing model a host designed to provide a service is called a server. Clients are hosts that make requests to that service. The HTTP specification defines how requests and responses should be formatted, but not what a service should represent. HTTP is often associated with serving .html files but is also used to transfer images, videos, .json, .xml, binary executables, and much more.

### HTTP Request 

HTTP METHOD | FUNCTION
------------|---------
GET | RETIRVE A RESOURCE
HEAD | LIKE GET BUT HEADERS ONLY
POST | CREATE A RESOURCE
PUT | UPDATE A RESOURCE 
DELETE | DELETE A RESOURCE
CONNECT | CREATE TCP/IP TUNNEL
OPTIONS | RETURNS SUPPORTED METHOD FOR A URL
TRACE | ECHOS RETRIVED REQUEST 
PATCH | PARTIAL MODIFICATION OF RESOURCE

### RESET
REST is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer. In layman’s terms, is a means by which we can reference, manipulate, and transfer state. Rest uses a common set of methods (called “verbs”) to operate on the state of a resource (“noun”), generally using HTTP as the transfer protocol.

A “RESTful Endpoint” is a URI that identifies the resource. When addressed with a proper method, you are able to effect state. In normal terms, this means “Performing CRUD operations over HTTP”

### Example
RESTful Endpoint: http://api.server.com/api/v1/people

http:// - Protocol/Scheme
api.server.com - Domain or Server
/api/v1 - API Endpoint
/people - The resource (This identifies a collection: all people)
/people/12345 - A more specific resource: The person with id 12345

REST Method | CRUD Operation | Function
------------|----------------|---------
GET	| READ | Retrieve 1 or More Records
POST | CREATE | Create a new record
PUT	| UPDATE | Update a record through replacement (Put it back)
PATCH |UPDATE | Update a record (just the parts that changed)
DESTROY | DELETE | Remove a record
