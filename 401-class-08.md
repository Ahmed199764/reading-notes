### Entry Point
Entry point is the javascript file that will be invoked when consumers of your module “require” it, this file will include the main logic for your module, or if it is a large module you can export public functions found with other files (typically in the lib directory)

### server.js - Hub, Exported Server
This is a node.js application/service that converts Highcharts.JS charts to static image files. It supports PNG, JPEG, SVG, and PDF output; and the input can be either SVG, or JSON-formatted chart options.

### What is Data Modelling?
Data modeling (data modelling) is the process of creating a data model for the data to be stored in a Database.

The two types of Data Models techniques are:-
1. Entity Relationship (E-R) Model
2. UML (Unified Modelling Language)

### Types of Data Models
1. Conceptual: This Data Model defines WHAT the system contains
2. Logical: Defines HOW the system should be implemented regardless of the DBMS
3. Physical: This Data Model describes HOW the system will be implemented using a specific DBMS system.

### routes/categories.js, etc - Routers and Handlers

##### Route Syntax
Instead of trying to shoe-horn route declarations into an existing syntax, Yesod’s approach is to use a simplified syntax designed just for routes. This has the advantage of making the code not only easy to write, but simple enough for someone with no Yesod experience to read and understand the sitemap of your application.

##### Handler specification
The last piece of the puzzle when declaring your resources is how they will be handled. There are three options in Yesod:
1. A single handler function for all request methods on a given route.
2. A separate handler function for each request method on a given route. Any other request method will generate a 405 Method Not Allowed response.
3. You want to pass off to a subsite.
