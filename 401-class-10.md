### Difference between Stack and Queue Data Structures ?
##### STACKS:-
1. Stacks are based on the LIFO principle, i.e., the element inserted at the last, is the first element to come out of the list.	
2. Insertion and deletion in stacks takes place only from one end of the list called the top.	
3. Insert operation is called push operation.	
4. Delete operation is called pop operation.	
5. In stacks we maintain only one pointer to access the list, called the top, which always points to the last element present in the list.

##### QUEUES:-
1. Queues are based on the FIFO principle, i.e., the element inserted at the first, is the first element to come out of the list.
2. Insertion and deletion in queues takes place from the opposite ends of the list. The insertion takes place at the rear of the list and the deletion takes place from the front of the list.
3. Insert operation is called enqueue operation.
4. Delete operation is called dequeue operation.
5. In queues we maintain two pointers to access the list, The front pointer always points to the first element inserted in the list and is still present, and the rear pointer always points to the last inserted element.
