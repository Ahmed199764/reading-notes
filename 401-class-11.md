## User Modeling
Modern web applications need to model sensitive information about their users. When a users provides an applications with sensitive information, they are trusting that it will not be leaked are misused

## Cryptography
Cryptography is the science which studies methods for encoding messages so that they can be read only by a person who knows the secret information required for decoding, called the key; it includes cryptanalysis, the science of decoding encrypted messages without possessing the proper key, and has several other branches.

## Hash Algorithms
A Cryptographic Hash Algorithm takes a piece of data and produces a hash that is deliberately difficult to reverse. If identical data is passed into the algorithm the same hash will always be produced. Hash algorithms are often used for checking the integrity of data.

## Cypher Algorithms
A Cryptographic Cypher Algorithm takes a piece of data and a key and produces encrypted data. Later the encrypted data can be reversed into the original data by decrypting it using the same key.

## Basic Authorization
Basic Authorization is a common method used to send a username and password in an HTTP request. The username and password are joined with a ‘:’ then “base64 encoded” and placed after the string ‘Basic ‘. The resulting string is set to the value of an Authorization header.
