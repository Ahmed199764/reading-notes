## OAUTH2.0
When you “Login with Google”, you’ve actually given the application (or website) the keys to some of your personal information and access levels at Google. Generally, sites and apps use this as a simplified way of having you login through one system … but if they’ve asked for it (and you agreed to it), the application can also do things such as create or delete documents or access other services “as you”. When you “Login with Google” the application that requested that, for all intents and purposes, Is You … which means it can effectively do things at Google (or facebook, or wherever) as though it was you at the keyboard

## How does OAuth work?
1. Application spawns the “Login Using xxx” window, asking for specific permissions
2. User Agrees to allow this to happen
3. Remote service (i.e. Google) contacts the application with a one-time-use Code
4. The application calls back to a special address on the remote service to exchange that Code for a Token
5. Once the token has been granted, the application will then be able to contact the remote service, using that Token to access information on behalf of the user

## Access Code
response_type=code indicates that your server wants to receive an authorization code
client_id=<your client id> tells the authorization server which app the user is granting access to
redirect_uri=<your redirect uri> tells the auth server which server endpoint to redirect to
scope=<list of scopes> tells the auth server what you want the user to give access to
state=<anything you want> a place where you can store info to pass to your server if you want

## Access Token
grant_type=authorization_code
code=<the code your received
redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI must be same as the redirect URI your client provided
client_id=<your client id> tells the authorization server which application is making the requests
client_secret=<your client secret> authenticates that the application making the request is the application registered with the client_id
Once you get an access token, you can use it to make API calls to the service on behalf of that user
