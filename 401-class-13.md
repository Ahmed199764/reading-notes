## Bearer Authentication
1. Bearer Tokens are sent to the user/client after the initial signin process has completed.
2. Clients must make every subsequent request to the server with that token, in the header
3. Authorization: Bearer encoded.jsonwebtoken.here
4. The server opens the token, does the re-authentication, and then grants or denies access
5. In express servers, this can be done in middleware, in conjunction with a user model

app.get('/somethingsecret', bearerToken, (req,res) => {
  res.status(200).send('secret sauce');
});

function bearerToken( req, res, next ) {
  let token = req.headers.authorization.split(' ').pop();
  try {
    if ( tokenIsValid(token) ) { next(); }
  }
  catch(e) { next("Invalid Token") }
}

function tokenIsValid(token) {
  let parsedToken = jwt.verify(token, SECRETKEY);
  return Users.find(parsedToken.id);
}

## JSON Web Tokens
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties (servers, clients, etc) as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

## When should you use JSON Web Tokens?
Authorization: This is the most common scenario for using JWT. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays, because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used across different domains.
