# Tree

## Why do we use tree in data structures
Tree data structures have many uses, and itâ€™s good to have a basic understanding of how they work. Trees are the basis for other very used data structures like Maps and Sets. Also, they are used on databases to perform quick searches. The HTML DOM uses a tree data structure to represents the hierarchy of elements. In this post, we are going to explore the different types of trees like a binary tree, binary search trees, and how to implement them.

## how to draw or uss the tree ? (example)

     /   <-- root
  /      \
...        home
      /          \
   ugrad        course
    /          /    |    \
  ...        cs101 cs112 cs113

## What is Binary Tree Data Structure ?
A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.
A Binary Tree node contains following parts.
1. Data
2. Pointer to left child
3. Pointer to right child
