# Event-Driven Programming

## What Is Event-Driven Programming And Why Is It So Popular?
Event-driven programming is currently the default paradigm in software engineering. As the name suggests, it uses events as the basis for developing the software. These events can be something the users are doing — clicking on a specific button, picking an option from drop-down, typing text into a field, giving voice commands, or uploading a video — or system-generated events such as a program loading.

##### Why Is It So Popular Right Now?
On the business development side, keeping the user engaged with your program is one clear way of making sure your app is actively used and offers value, so it makes sense to build your applications with this focus in mind.

Event-driven programming serves the user with the quickest and most accurate responses and this usually translates into better user experience and business gains. Also, the whole focus of software development is on the actual people using the app and their actions, so it will produce better and more intuitive products for the end-users.

The opposite of event-driven programming would be software that doesn’t need any user input to act. There are definitely valid use cases for this as well but the majority of popular applications on the market right now function through user input (all the social media platforms, games, productivity tools, etc).
