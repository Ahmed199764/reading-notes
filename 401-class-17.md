## Event Queues
Much of the NodeJS architecture is built around the use of events. All objects that emit events in NodeJS are instances of the EventEmitter constructor. EventEmitter’s are a great way to handle controlling asynchronous events. Functions can be registered as listeners for an event on instances of the EventEmitter class. These instances can emit events and pass the listener’s data.

## OSI Model
Programmers and engineers have been able to network computers since the early 1970s. As the needs of networked computers evolved, there where many solutions developed to connect two ore more computers together and share information between them.

## Internet Protocol Suite
The Internet Protocol Suite is the conceptual model for the protocols used by the internet. It is often referred to as TCP/IP because the IP and TCP were the original protocols in the suite. The Internet Protocol Suite is described using four layers - Link, Internet, Transport, and Application. Web developers often reference the Internet Protocol Suite model when discussing network communication and data exchange.

Layer | Function | Examples
------|----------|---------
Application	| Provides high level data exchange for use in user application development | HTTP, SMTP, FTP, DHCP
Transport | Provides process to process data exchange |	TCP, UDP, µTP
Internet | Maintains computer addressing and identification and manages packet routing | IPv4, IPv6, ICMP
Link layer | Used to move packets between two different hosts |	MAC, ARP, DSL, Ethernet

## TCP 
TCP HEADER
The TCP Header is used at each end to control the type of interaction being sent. It contains the following information:-
Byte 0: Source port
Byte 3: Destination port
Byte 4: Sequence number
Byte 8: Acknowledgement number
Byte 12: Data Offset, NS flag, and 3 undefined bits
Byte 13: CWR, ECE, URG, ACK, PSH, RST, SYN, and FYN flags
Byte 14: Window size
Byte 16: Checksum
Byte 18: Urgent pointer
Byte 20: Options
