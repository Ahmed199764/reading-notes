## Message Queues

A Queue server runs independently, and is tasked with routing events and messaging between clients:-
1. Any connected client can “publish” a message into the server.
2. Any connected client can “subscribe” to receive messages by type

#### What is a message?
A message is a package of information, categorized by queue and event
1. queue - Which general bucket does this message belong
A) i.e. “Database Events”, “Filesystem Events”, “Network Events”, etc
2. event - What event has happened
B) i.e. “delete, add, update, connection lost, error”, etc.
3. payload - data associated with the event
C) i.e. “record id, record information, error text”, etc.

### Real Time vs Queued Messaging
In some cases, messages are simply brokered by the server. They come in, are processed and are immediately broadcast out to subscribers. Should a subscriber at any point lose connection with the server, any messages broadcast by the server will clearly be missed by the client. These are known as “Real Time” messaging systems.

A true “Queue” will keep track of the delivery status of every event/message. Any broadcast that is not received by a subscriber will remain “in the queue” until it can be delivered. In this type of systems, rather than a broadcasting of messages, clients will likely “poll” the server to retrieve any messages “in the queue” for them, on their own timeline/schedule.

### Use Case
-An API server responds to a POST request
  -User’s access rights are confirmed
  -The data is analyzed and normalized
  -The data is sent to the database for saving
  -The database “publishes” a message into the queue
     -Queue: DB
     -Event: CREATE
     -Payload: JSON Object containing the created record
  -The API server sends information back to it’s client as normal
