# Class27-React Testing and Deployment

### React Testing
Snapshots - Make assertions on the exact rendered markup (with content) at any state of the application.
Render Testing - Similar to snapshots, but allows for jQuery-like inspection of the virtual DOM tree
Shallow Testing - Executes and renders the called/container component, but does not compose children.
Mounting - Executes the full component and children. Allows for inspection of rendered Virtual DOM as well as the current state

### Deployment commend
npm run build

### Deploying to AWS (s3)
