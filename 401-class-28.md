# Class28-React Props and State

## What are props?
Props is short for properties and they are used to pass data between React components. React’s data flow between components is uni-directional (from parent to child only).

## How do you pass data with props?
Here is an example of how data can be passed by using props:

class ParentComponent extends Component {    
    render() {    
        return (        
            < ChildComponent name="First Child" />    
        );  
    }
}

const ChildComponent = (props) => {    
    return < p>{props.name}< /p>; 
};

Firstly, we need to define/get some data from the parent component and assign it to a child component’s “prop” attribute.

< ChildComponent name="First Child" />

“Name” is a defined prop here and contains text data. Then we can pass data with props like we’re giving an argument to a function:

const ChildComponent = (props) => {  
  // statements
};

And finally, we use dot notation to access the prop data and render it:
return < p>{props.name}< /p>;

## What is state?
React has another special built-in object called state, which allows components to create and manage their own data. So unlike props, components cannot pass data with state, but they can create and manage it internally.

Here is an example showing how to use state:
class Test extends React.Component {    
    constructor() {    
        this.state = {      
            id: 1,      
            name: "test"    
        };  
    }    
    
    render() {    
        return (      
            <div>        
              <p>{this.state.id}</p>        
              <p>{this.state.name}</p>      
            </div>    
        );  
    }
}

## How do you update a component’s state?
State should not be modified directly, but it can be modified with a special method called setState( ).

this.state.id = “2020”; // wrong

this.setState({         // correct  
    id: "2020"
});
