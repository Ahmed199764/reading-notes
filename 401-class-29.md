# WHAT'S COMPOSITION IN CODE?
Let's take on step backwards before tackling composition in React. What's composition in general? It's the ingredients and the arrangement of these ingredients to create something bigger out of it. It's the samples in a piece of music that make up a track. It's the fruits that are used for the perfect smoothie. It's the choreography of dancers in a musical. And it's the internals of a function in programming that need to be arranged in a way to get the desired output:

const convertCurrency = (amount, fromCurrency, toCurrency) => {
  const conversionRate = getConversionRate(fromCurrency, toCurrency);
  const newAmount = applyConversionRate(amount, conversionRate);
 
  return newAmount;
};

In functional programming, the composition of functions is ubiquitous:
const convertCurrency = (amount, fromCurrency, toCurrency) => compose(
    applyConversionRate(amount),
    getConversionRate(fromCurrency, toCurrency),
  );

# WHY REACT COMPONENT COMPOSITION?
You have seen how multiple functions can be composed together to achieve something bigger. The same applies to HTML elements and beyond to React components too. Let's encounter both, HTML element composition and React component composition, with a form that submits data. In HTML that form element could look like the following:

< form action="javascript:onSubmit();">
  < label>
    Your name: < input type="text" value="">
  < /label>
 
  < button type="submit">Send< /button>
< /form>
