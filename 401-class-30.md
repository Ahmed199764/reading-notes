# Hashtables

# What is Hash ?
A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.

# Why we use Hash ?
1. Hold unique values
2. Dictionary
3. Library

# HOW the key/values are stored in the array ?
Each index of the array can hold many types of values. The trick is how the values are stored in comparison to efficiency. Each Index of the array contain “buckets”. Each of these “buckets” holds one key/value pair combination. When there is no entry in a specific bucket, the buckets (each index of the array) all start null. The hash table starts each bucket empty and overwrites their value once a key generates a hashCode that corresponds with an index.
