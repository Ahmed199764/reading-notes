# HOOKS

# What is hooks ?
React hooks allow to to easily create and manage state in a functional component.

## Rules 
1. Hooks must be named with a use prefix (i.e. useFishingPole)
2. Only call Hooks at the top level. Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
3. Only call Hooks from React function components. Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. (There is just one other valid place to call Hooks — your own custom Hooks. We’ll learn about them in a moment.)

## Built In Hooks
useState()

## Motivation
Hooks solve a wide variety of seemingly unconnected problems in React that we’ve encountered over five years of writing and maintaining tens of thousands of components. Whether you’re learning React, use it daily, or even prefer a different library with a similar component model, you might recognize some of these problems.

## Extra
Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let you use React without classes. 

React provides a few built-in Hooks like useState. You can also create your own Hooks to reuse stateful behavior between different components.
