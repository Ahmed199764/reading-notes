# How to Add User Authentication to Your React App
If you have a functional web app, you can add some personalization by allowing users to sign in. One simple way to add authentication to your project is with Okta, Our API enables you to
1. Authenticate and authorize your users
2. Store data about your users
3. Perform password-based and social login
4. Secure your application with multi-factor authentication

### Code Example 
{authenticated !== null && (
  < button
    onClick={() => authenticated ? auth.logout() : auth.login()}
    className="App-link">
    Log {authenticated ? 'out' : 'in'}
  </ button>
)}

if (user) {
  url.searchParams.set('firstName', user.given_name);
  url.searchParams.set('lastName', user.family_name);
}



#### A good authentication system is a crucial ingredient for building modern apps, and also one of the most common challenges that app developers face.

There are several contributing factors that make designing good authentication flows a challenge. For instance, OAuth flows work ever slightly so differently across providers. And handling a client-side only flow is quite different than a middleware based flow. Further, there are different kinds of authentication flows: sometimes, you may want a passwordless authentication and other times, you may want an old-school username and password based flow. And once you have implemented an auth flow, handling user authorizations is an altogether different challenge.

### building an Authentication flow for a client-only React app with a very simple authorization rule:
1. Display a database connected UI view that is only visible to logged in users. using ReactiveSearch for building this quickly, but the walk through should apply the same for any React view.
2. Using Auth0 to implement the authentication flow that will support logging in either via an e-mail / password mechanism or a Google OAuth login
