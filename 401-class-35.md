# Graphs

## What is the diffrent between Directed and undirected graphs

### Directed graphs 
have edges with direction. The edges indicate a one-way relationship, in that each edge can only be traversed in a single direction. This figure shows a simple directed graph with three nodes and two edges.

### Undirected graphs
Undirected graphs have edges that do not have a direction. The edges indicate a two-way relationship, in that each edge can be traversed in both directions

## What Is a Graph?
A graph is a collection of nodes and edges that represents relationships:

1. Nodes are vertices that correspond to objects.

2. Edges are the connections between objects.

3. The graph edges sometimes have Weights, which indicate the strength (or some other attribute) of each connection between the nodes.
