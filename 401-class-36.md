# Redux

## Store
A store holds the whole state tree of your application. The only way to change the state inside it is to dispatch an action on it.

A store is not a class. It's just an object with a few methods on it. To create it, pass your root reducing function to createStore.

## Store Methods
1. getState()
2. dispatch(action)
3. subscribe(listener)
4. replaceReducer(nextReducer)

### getState()
Returns the current state tree of your application. It is equal to the last value returned by the store's reducer.

### dispatch(action)
Dispatches an action. This is the only way to trigger a state change.

The store's reducing function will be called with the current getState() result and the given action synchronously. Its return value will be considered the next state. It will be returned from getState() from now on, and the change listeners will immediately be notified.

### subscribe(listener)
Adds a change listener. It will be called any time an action is dispatched, and some part of the state tree may potentially have changed. You may then call getState() to read the current state tree inside the callback.

### replaceReducer(nextReducer)
Replaces the reducer currently used by the store to calculate the state.

It is an advanced API. You might need this if your app implements code splitting, and you want to load some of the reducers dynamically. You might also need this if you implement a hot reloading mechanism for Redux.
