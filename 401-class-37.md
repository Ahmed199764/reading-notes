# Redux - Combined Reducers

### actions?
Each reducer technically has it’s own actions and creators.
However, they can cross over and both be dispatched.
In this example, if an action of type ‘RESET’ is ever dispatched by any action creator, both of the reducers would actually respond.
This can be` very powerful, as often times actions are valid for multiple reducers
… but this behavior needs to be well understood or it’ll cause unintended consequences.

### Combined Reducers
Combined reducers is nothing more than pulling in more than one reducer from source and creating a keyed object from them.

### How to organize individual reducers with combineReducers
We have seen how reducers in a React/Redux application take the existing state and an action and return a new, updated state object that can then be displayed by the application.

Reducers know how to update the state by looking at the type of action coming in. If the action is of type UPDATE_TITLE, for example, they run logic that updates the title. If the action is of type TURN_TITLE_GREEN, they run logic that makes the title green, and so on.
The way reducers implement this logic is by using conditional statements
