# Async Actions

# Actions
When you call an asynchronous API, there are two crucial moments in time: the moment you start the call, and the moment when you receive an answer (or a timeout).

Each of these two moments usually require a change in the application state; to do that, you need to dispatch normal actions that will be processed by reducers synchronously. Usually, for any API request you'll want to dispatch at least three different kinds of actions:

1. An action informing the reducers that the request began.
2. An action informing the reducers that the request finished successfully.
3. An action informing the reducers that the request failed.

# Async Flow
Without middleware, Redux store only supports synchronous data flow. This is what you get by default with createStore().
We can enhance createStore() with applyMiddleware(). It is not required, but it lets you express asynchronous actions in a convenient way.

Using Redux actions to connect to remote APIs via Thunk Middleware

Normally, action generators return a function, like this:

const get = (payload) => {
  return {
    type: 'GET',
    payload: payload
  }
}
