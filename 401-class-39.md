# Redux - Additional Topics

## Other ways to build and manage a Redux store
Let’s face it, Redux is great, but there’s a lot of “boilerplate” code that you have write, and every developer or company will have their own internal pattern for putting it all together

1. File and Directory Names
2. Reducer and Action Styles
3. How do we model our data in the reducers

## Redux Toolkit
The makers of Redux have recognized that Redux is complicated and have introduced a “Batteries Included, Highly Opinionated” framework for making stores called the Redux Toolkit

This toolkit specifies a few different means of building a reducer and action set that work well together and are easier to understand and integrate

Ultimately, your store code can be as simple and declarative as this:

```javascript

const postsSlice = createSlice({ name: ‘posts’, initialState: [], reducers: { createPost(state, action) {}, updatePost(state, action) {}, deletePost(state, action) {} } })

Extract the action creators object and the reducer const { actions, reducer } = postsSlice
Extract and export each action creator by name export const { createPost, updatePost, deletePost } = actions 
Export the reducer, either as a default or named export export default reducer

 ————— Sample Use ————– 
console.log(createPost({ id: 123, title: ‘Hello World’ }))
{type : “posts/createPost”, payload : {id : 123, title : “Hello World”}}
