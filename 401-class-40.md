# React Native

 React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook.It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Web and UWP by enabling developers to use React along with native platform capabilities.


### Implementation

 The working principles of React Native are virtually identical to React except that React Native does not manipulate the DOM via the Virtual DOM. It runs in a background process (which interprets the JavaScript written by the developers) directly on the end-device and communicates with the native platform via a serialisation, asynchronous and batched Bridge.

React components wrap existing native code and interact with native APIs via Reactâ€™s declarative UI paradigm and JavaScript. This enables native app development for whole new teams of developers, and can let existing native teams work much faster.

React Native does not use HTML or CSS. Instead, messages from the JavaScript thread are used to manipulate native views. React Native also allows developers to write native code in languages such as Java for Android and Objective-C or Swift for iOS which make it even more flexible.

### Hello World Example
A Hello, World program in React Native looks like this:

import React from 'react';
import { AppRegistry, Text } from 'react-native';

const HelloWorldApp = () => < Text>Hello world!< /Text>;
export default HelloWorldApp;

// Skip this line if using Create React Native App
AppRegistry.registerComponent('HelloWorld', () => HelloWorldApp);

// The React native code can also be imported from another component with the following code:
import HelloWorldApp from './HelloWorldApp';
