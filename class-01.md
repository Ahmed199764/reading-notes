# how the web works
#### When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

### Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.

# attributes
Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.

# HTML5
In HTML5, web page authors do not need to close all tags, and new elements and attributes will be introduced. At the time of writing, the HTML5 specification had not been completed, but the major browser makers had started to implement many of the new features, and web page authors were rapidly adopting the new markup.
Despite the fact that HTML5 is not yet completed, you can safely take advantage of the new features of the language as long as you endeavour to ensure that users with older browsers will be able to view your pages (even though some of the extra features will not be visible to them).

id attribute | class attribute 
-------------|----------------
Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page | Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page

# Block Elemtnes
Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements.

# Inline Elemtns 
Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as inline elements

# <div>
The <div> element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box

# <span>
The <span> element acts like an inline equivalent of the <div> element

# <iframe>
An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page â€” and in that window you can see another page. The term iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame.
  
# <meta>
The <meta> element lives inside the <head> element and contains information about that web page.

# <nav>
The <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
  
# <article>
The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.

# <aside>
The <aside> element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an <article> element or not.

# <section>
The <section> element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.
  
# <hgroup>
The purpose of the <hgroup> element is to group together a set of one or more <h1> through <h6> elements so that they are treated as one single heading.
  
# <figure>
 It can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article (not just images)
  
#  <figcaption>
 provides a text decription for the content of the <figure> element.
 
# WireFrames
A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

# Process & Design:-
1. It's important to understand who your target audience  X is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.
2. Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site
3. Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
4. Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
5. You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
6. You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.

# What is script?
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 

# Objects(Things)
In computer programming, each physical thing in the world can be represented as an **object**.

Each object can have its own: 
1. Properties
2. Events
3. Methods
Together they create a working model of that object.

# Events 
In the real world, people interact with objects. These interactions can change the values of the properties in these objects.

# METHODS
Methods represent things people need to do with objects. They can retrieve or update the values of an object's properties.
