## There is 3 types of lists :-
1. Orderd lists created with ol element and li.
2. Unorderd lists created with ul element and li.
3. Definition lists created with dl element and dt+dd.

## Nested lists 
we can put list inside list , more than 1 time , maybe 2 lists inside 1 list and so on.

## div .box helps us to creat new box around the div , then we can give it width and height.

## min-width and max-width
  the min-width property specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow, and the max-width property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide.

## min-height and max-height
the same way we give limits to the width from min to max , we can do the same with height.

## Overflow
its help the broswer to be flixable, there is 2 types.
1. hidden : hide the extra contant.
2. scroll : insert and scroll into the broswer , so you simply scroll down and check the whole page.

## Every box have 3 important properties :-
1. border : every box have it even if its not visible
2. margie : outside the edge.
3. padding : the spaces between the border.

## Border width 
this properity is used to control the size of our border thin, meduim, thick , also we can control each edge of the border, the top one, the bottom one.

## Border style 
we can control the style through border-style, solid, dotte, dashed, double, groove, ridge, inset, outsdet, hidden.
also we can change the style  of each egde.
same things works with border colors.

## border
the border property allow us to specify the border size , type and color.

## Display
1. inline : a block level element that act like inline element.
2. block : a inline element to act like a block-level element
3. inline-block : a block level element to flow like an inline element while retaining other features of a block-level element.
4. none: This hides an element from the page.

## Visibility 
it used to hide a box, or to show it up.

## border-image
it is take any image and put it as background in the border , we can use 3 ways to show the images, 
stretch stretches the image repeat repeats the image round like repeat but if the  tiles do not fit exactly, scales  the tile image so they will.

## Box-shadow 
The box-shadow property allows you to add a drop shadow around a box.

1. horizontal offset
2. vertical offset 
3. Blur Distance 
4. spread of shAdow

## rounded corners
border-radius : change the corners degree, we can also change 1 corner if needed.

## If stetment , For loop , Switch How to use them , examples on them and syntex.

## Data type and thier purpose as String = Text , number = number , boolen = true or false , null will be empty value and undefiend a value that declared to be not defiend.

## Examples on Truthy and falsy values.

##  Loops (For, while, do while)
1. For used if you wanted to repeat a code many times.
2. while is used when you dont know how many times you need to run your code.
3. do while its gona always run the code at least one time even if the value is fales.
