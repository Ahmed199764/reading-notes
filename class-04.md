## Links
we creat a link in our browser with < a > tag also we have to put href inside it to link to our source.
to name our link we have just to put the name we want between the start and end tags.
we can link to the same page or another page , we control that from the href.

## Directory structure
when we have a huge website it is a good idea to organize our code by placing pages into folders so will make our work organized and more easier.

## Relative URLS
it can be used when we want to create a hyperlink to take us from page to our website, its like a short way.

Relative link type | Example
-------------------|---------
SAME FOLDER | < a href="reviews.html" >Reviews< /a >
child folder | < a href="music/listings.html">Listings< /a >
grandchild folder | < a href="movies/dvd/reviews.html"> Reviews< /a>
parent folder | < a href="../index.html">Home< /a>
grandparent folder | < a href="../../index.html">Home< /a>

## Email Links 
mailto : its like creating a link source for the email you want , all what we have to do is put the email link into the source.

## opening a link in a new windo
We have to use **Target** , this will open a new windo without close the main one.

## Linking to A specific part of the same Page
We can do it through ID attributes , just put the id u named in the source.

#### Normal Flow it takes position : static 
#### Relative positioning it takes position : relative
#### absoLute positioning it takes position : absolute
#### Fixed positioning it takes position : fixed
#### OverLapping it takes z-index (this will back the text behinde the Screen)
#### Floating Elements it takes float (move our element to right or left depends on what do we want)
#### Clearing flots it takes just Clear (no element can touch the left or right)
#### Parents of floated elements : problem (its like put a line between the head and our paragraph)
#### parents of floated elements: solution ( its like put all our paragraph inside a box)

#### Screen resolution 
Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

### fixed width Layouts
the users cant change the size of the windo cuz its fixed already.

### Liquid Layouts
the users can change the size of the windo cuz its liquid as the name says.

### Layout grids
its like organize the elements in our visual studio its like art and design and its so helpful to the programers.

### What is the function ?
to creat a specific task or project we need to regroup multi series of codes or statments, then we can keep call this function many times and repeat it.

#### We can declare a function that need information , like give it parameters ,and then call those parameters to do a specific task.
