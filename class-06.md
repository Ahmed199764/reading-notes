### What is the hardest things the programmers deal with when they write the code?
1. Learning a new technology or programming lang
2. Naming things 
3. Test the codes and debugging then fix the bugs
4. making software maintainable
but the hardest step ever is learning the problem domain.

## Pro programmers 
Pro Programmers have to understand what is the domain , why its hard, how to use it.
understand the domain = programming is easy.
but to understand it ,will be really hard at start but later on you will be used on it.

such as object name of the car ,type of care ,care color etc...
